I.e the algorithm should be able to recognize invariant representation of the image (unchanged when a specified transformation is applied). The following are image invariance:\n","* **Scale Invariance:** when the model does not change its prediction irrespective of the size of the object.\n","* **Rotation Invariance:** when angle of the object in the image does not matter.\n","* **Translation Invariance:** when position of the image does not matter (CNN has some built in translation invariance).\n","\n","### Augmentation\n","To make network become insensitive to changes such as rotation, translation, and dilation, perform **augmentation** on the image to generate new images, i.e use the same input image and rotate it, translate it, and scale it and ask the network not to change its prediction!\n","\n","In practice, this is achieved by applying random transformations to the input images before they are fed to the network. Advantages of image augmentation includes:\n","1. Increase the robustness of the network\n","2. Avoid overfitting\n","3. Introduce rotational, translational and scale invariance as well as\n","4. Insensitiveness to color changes\n","5.
